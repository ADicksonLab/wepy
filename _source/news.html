<p>A preprint for the academic paper describing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wepy</span></code> has been published
on <a class="reference external" href="https://chemrxiv.org/s/369c2530c150add1450b">ChemRxiv</a>.</p>
<p>This paper goes into more detail regarding some of the relationships of
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wepy</span></code> architecture to the mathematical descriptions of Weighted
Ensemble (WE) in general.</p>
<p>It also describes some of the challenges and solutions that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wepy</span></code>
solves with regards to the complexity of WE trajectory data that is
different from normal linear trajectories.</p>
<p>In these respects it is a great supplementary resource for understanding
some of the higher-level issues <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wepy</span></code> solves.</p>

<h2>Wepy 1.0 Release<a class="headerlink" href="#wepy-1-0-release" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>&lt;2020-08-04 Tue&gt;</p>
<p>We are finally releasing the official 1.0 version of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wepy</span></code>.</p>
<p>This will make <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">wepy</span></code> point to the correct mostly up to
date version which has been a point of confusion in the past.</p>
<p>In the past few months not a lot of changes to the code has occured
(despite being used by many people) and most of the progress has occured
around improving the developer workflows for writing and testing
examples and tutorials.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone to look through the documentation and see what all
there is to learn! Also, not all of the documentation materials are
complete at this point, but will be filled out in the coming months as
time allows.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We have placed special focus on testing examples, tutorials, and all
documentation pages using a combination of a careful structure for
inputs and outputs and the tangling properties of both org-mode
documents and Jupyter Notebooks that also allow for web presentation.</p>
<p>This is quite different from any other open source project I have seen
which often emphasize the testing of the code base through unit and
integration tests. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wepy</span></code> unfortunately does not have hardly any unit
or integration tests. We have tried to start these in the past but not
having test driven practice from the beginning this is a massive,
thankless, and difficult undertaking that wouldn’t provide much value.
Instead one of the major hurdles for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wepy</span></code> users is just to
understand how to connect all the parts and pieces that it offers in
coherent ways. As the main developer I always had specific pipelines in
mind when I wrote components but this isn’t always evident to users.
That is why the tutorials and examples are so important.</p>
<p>So I was incentived to produce tutorials and full examples of working
code which actually provides value to the users. The problem with these
code bases is that they often go stale and don’t work for users for a
variety of reasons. These are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>details of the environment are different (e.g. version of the
package, external programs like OpenMM and CUDA).</p></li>
<li><p>the code simply isn’t up to date with the code and is erroneous.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It follows that we need the first point in order to solve the second
one. That is, to test we need to specify environments. This is often
solved with tools like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tox</span></code> (we use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nox</span></code> which is essentially the
same thing). We have added a more static configuration concept to
accompany this by the use of a series of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requirements.in/txt</span></code> files
that can be specified, compiled, and pinned. This allows both <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nox</span></code> to
create proper test environments and for the users to also create
environments in an explicit and “executable” format so they can
troubleshoot if they need.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this gives the author of the tutorial some confidence that
the other dependent libraries will work when installed by the audience,
since they are being pinned.</p>
<p>The process of testing the tutorials isn’t that complex but it did
require a discipline of how to organize your tutorials. This allows for
a building process to “tangle” the correct code from tutorial sources,
and then execute this code. Tests are then written in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pytest</span></code> under
the right category. Minimally, you can just run the code to see if it
works. You can also fairly easily test to see that certain files were
indeed produced. The sky of course is the limit and you could make
detailed tests for the textual output of these programs.</p>
<p>Its worth noting that more established documentation testing tools like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doctest</span></code> for python do not help you in the same context. These are
for running short, single line examples ideally in an interactive
interpreter. These kinds of tests cannot do anything for you if your
inputs are complicated or simply need to be read from a file. You cannot
run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doctest</span></code> snippets for anything involving I/O (at least that I am
aware of and then setting this up would be highly non-trivial).
Furthermore, testing for outputs is a non-starter. Furthermore, many
projects involve documentation which involves running things at a shell,
which is totally outside of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doctest</span></code> purview.</p>
<p>I also believe that having these extra requirements for tests, directory
structure, writing format etc. makes for a clear-cut requirement for
what a tutorial or example needs to be for it to be included in the
repository (editorial decisions of content aside). This takes out some
of the ambiguity and anxiety that may surround greenlighting a community
contributed tutorial (or for yourself so you know when its “done” as in
publishable).</p>
<p>Additionally, the documentation tests serve kind of as integration tests
in their own sense. They are a good starting off point for establishing
tests that also delivers immediate value to the project by making it
easier for users to get started.</p>

<h2>Tutorial for Contributors for Running and Writing Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#tutorial-for-contributors-for-running-and-writing-examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>&lt;2020-04-29 Wed&gt;</p>
<p>We have a separate repository where we save all the workshops we have
done for the users/contributors in our lab:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/ADicksonLab/wepy-developer-resources">https://gitlab.com/ADicksonLab/wepy-developer-resources</a></p>
<p>These are topics which may change throughout time, so we don’t include
them in the main <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wepy</span></code> tree nor do we guarantee they will work in
perpetuity.</p>
<p>Today we are running a workshop on getting people started running &amp;
writing examples for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wepy</span></code>:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/ADicksonLab/wepy-developer-resources/-/tree/master/workshops/2020-04-29_Examples-Tutorials-HOWTO">Examples &amp; Tutorials
HOWTO</a></p>
<p>In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wepy</span></code> project we have a number of utilities which we think
will help us in keeping the examples in our docs up to date with the
code.</p>
<p>Outdated docs are a frequent problem with software projects. Hopefully,
the strategies that we start to outline here can help you in all your
software projects by gaining a discipline of carefully maintaining and
pinning your dependencies for purpose-driven virtualenvs.</p>
<p>A common structure for writing examples and tutorials also helps to
allow for automated processes to create and test them in a uniform and
low friction way.</p>
