NEWS for python-fstab
=====================

Version 1.4, released 2009-03-18

    * Bugfix. A valid mount point that was commented out with just a
      single comment character at the beginning did not used to be
      ignored as it should be. Now it is.

Version 1.3, released 2008-10-08

    * Bugfix. When writing a new fstab file, it is written to a temporary
      file first. This temporary file is now placed in the same directory
      as the target file, so that we can safely do an atomic rename to
      the target name. This only works within a filesystem. Earlier the
      temporary file was in /tmp, which can be on a different filesystem.
      Thanks to user kang on Launchpad for reporting this.
