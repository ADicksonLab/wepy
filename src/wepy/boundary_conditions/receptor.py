    Implements the ReceptorBC superclass.

    This boundary condition will warp walkers to a number of initial
    states whenever a walker becomes very close to the native (bound)
    state.

    Thus the choice of the 'initial_states' argument should be walkers
    which are completely unbound (the choice of which are weighted by
    'initial_weight') and the choice of 'native_state' should be of a
    ligand bound to the receptor, e.g. X-ray crystallography or docked
    structure.

    The cutoff for the boundary is an RMSD of the walker to the native
    state which is calculated by first aligning and superimposing the
    entire structure according the atom indices specified in
    'binding_site_idxs', and as the name suggests should correspond to
    some approximation of the binding site of the ligand that occurs
    in the native state. Then the raw RMSD of the native and walker
    ligands is calculated. If this RMSD is less than the 'cutoff_rmsd'
    argument the walker is warped.

    PROGRESS is reported for each walker from this rmsd.
