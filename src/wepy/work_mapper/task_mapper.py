    """Process-per-task mapper.

    This method of work mapper starts new processes for each runner
    segment task that needs to be run. This allows cheap copying of
    shared state using the operating system primitives. On linux this
    would be either 'fork' (default) or 'spawn'. Fork is cheap but
    doesn't initialize certain process namespace things, whereas spawn
    is much more expensive but properly cleans things up. Fork should
    be sufficient in most cases, however spawn may be needed when you
    have some special contexts in the parent process. This is the case
    with starting CUDA contexts in the main parent process and then
    forking new processes from it. We suggest using fork and avoiding
    making these kinds of contexts in the main process.

    This method avoids using shared memory or sending objects through
    interprocess communication (that has a serialization and
    deserialization cost associated with them) by using OS copying
    mechanism. However, a new process will be created each cycle for
    each walker in the simulation. So if you want a large number of
    walkers you may experience a large overhead. If your walker states
    are very small or a very fast serializer is available you may also
    not benefit from full process address space copies. Instead the
    WorkerMapper may be better suited.
