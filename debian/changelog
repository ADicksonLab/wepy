python-fstab (1.2-0ubuntu1) intrepid; urgency=low

  * When writing an fstab, copy its permissions to the temporary file.
  * debian/control: Added Vcs-Bzr and Homepage headers. Thanks to toobaz
    for the suggestion.
  * debian/copyright: Fixed to refer to /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3,
    instead of GPL-2, since that's the right copyright license. Thanks
    to Colin Watson for pointing this out.
  * Changed copyright to be GPL-3 only. (GPL-3 now also included in the
    file COPYING. Oops.)
