A preprint for the academic paper describing ~wepy~ has been published
on [[https://chemrxiv.org/s/369c2530c150add1450b][ChemRxiv]].

This paper goes into more detail regarding some of the relationships
of the ~wepy~ architecture to the mathematical descriptions of
Weighted Ensemble (WE) in general.

It also describes some of the challenges and solutions that ~wepy~
solves with regards to the complexity of WE trajectory data that is
different from normal linear trajectories.

In these respects it is a great supplementary resource for
understanding some of the higher-level issues ~wepy~ solves. 


Enjoy,
