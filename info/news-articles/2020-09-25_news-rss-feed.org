I have now made an RSS feed for this news section:
https://adicksonlab.github.io/wepy/news.rss

You can follow releases of packages using the services they are
deployed on:

- [[https://pypi.org/rss/project/wepy/releases.xml][PyPI]]
- Github:
  - [[https://github.com/ADicksonLab/wepy/releases.atom][Releases]]
  - [[https://github.com/ADicksonLab/wepy/commits.atom][Commits]]
  - [[https://github.com/ADicksonLab/wepy/tags.atom][Tags]]


If you aren't familiar you'll need to get a Feed Reader applications
that basically goes and fetches the RSS (or Atom) feed pages and
provides you a readable digest of the articles there.
