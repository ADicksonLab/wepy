*** My results files are large, can I compress them?

There is an HDF5 tool that allows you to "repack" and compress your
datasets called ~h5repack~. A good ratio of compression to time is
using GZIP level 2 but read the documentation to customize for
yourself:

#+begin_src bash
h5repack -f GZIP=2 original.wepy.h5 compressed.wepy.h5
#+end_src

There are other more involved mechanisms, but this should cut your
size significantly.
