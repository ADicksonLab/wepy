* Working with HDF5

The wepy.hdf5 module is part of the WEPY (Weighted Ensemble Pathway)
framework, used for handling HDF5 files that store simulation data. This
module helps in reading, writing, and managing the simulation data
stored in HDF5 format.

To work with an HDF5 file, you need to create a WepyHDF5 object. It is a
good idea to open the file "r+" mode which will append to the file
instead of overwriting it.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    from wepy.hdf5 import WepyHDF5

    # Open an existing HDF5 file or create a new one
    wepy_h5 = WepyHDF5('path_to_your_file.h5', mode='r+')  # 'r' for read, 'w' for write, 'a' for append
#+END_SRC

You can access the trajectories stored in the HDF5 file:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    with wepy_h5:
        trajs = wepy_h5.get_run_trajs(run_idx=0)
#+END_SRC

To extract specific data, such as configurations or observables:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    with wepy_h5
        configurations = wepy_h5.get_run_configurations(run_idx=0)
        observables = wepy_h5.get_run_observable_field(run_idx=0, obs_field='your_observable')
#+END_SRC

To write data into the HDF5 file:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    with wepy_h5:
        wepy_h5.add_run(new_run)
        wepy_h5.add_run_configurations(run_idx=0, configurations=new_configurations)
        wepy_h5.add_run_observable_field(run_idx=0, obs_field='your_observable', data=new_data)
#+END_SRC

Always close the HDF5 file after operations:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    wepy_h5.close()
#+END_SRC
