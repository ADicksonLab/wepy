* HDF5

** TODO [#A] sparse velocities etc. across trajectory                  :core:
** TODO [#A] restarting simulations, multiple runs                     :core:


** TODO [#B] full slice across datasets in TrajHDF5                 :feature:

get all values for a collection of indices, with fancy slicing

** TODO [#B] allow for arbitrary number of frames to be saved in HDF5 traj part :core:


** TODO [#B] allow for passing in of real np.dtypes to resampling records :core:

special handling for the variable length "tokens"

** TODO [#B] original WExplore algorithm                            :feature:
** TODO [#C] implement chunking strategies                          :feature:

** TODO [#C] compliance infrastructure                              :feature:

** TODO [#C] only accept Quantity type objects that match/convert units :feature:

This will require choosing a unit library:
- simtk.units
- pint

** TODO [#C] HDF5 topology                                    :core:topology:

** TODO [#C] simulation reproducibility metadata                    :feature:

** TODO [#C] traj object for trajs in WepyHDF5                      :feature:

This would have the same API as the TrajHDF5 object.

** TODO [#C] HDF5 topology                                    :core:topology:

This needs to be developed.
- JSON represenation also capable to be converted to and from
