* HDF5

** TODO write the reader for a file 

- [ ] determine and set the run counter by looking at names of the runs

** TODO __del__ operator correctly                                     :core:

** TODO implement chunking strategies                               :feature:

- [ ] protein, ligand, solvent
- [ ] ligand, binding-site


** TODO full slice across datasets in TrajHDF5                      :feature:

get all values for a collection of indices, with fancy slicing

** TODO sparse velocities etc. across trajectory                    :feature:

** TODO comliance infrastructure                                    :feature:

** TODO units in TrajHDF5                                              :core:

** TODO simulation reproducibility metadata                         :feature:

** TODO setters for forces, parameters, and observables                :core:

THis needs to be in both HDF5 classes

** TODO get number of atoms from the topology                 :core:topology:

** TODO context manager capable                                     :feature:

** TODO traj object for trajs in WepyHDF5                              :core:

This would have the same API as the TrajHDF5 object.
