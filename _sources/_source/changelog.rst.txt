1.0.8 - Unreleased
------------------

-  Fixes uninitialized discontinuities when not using boundary
   conditions in a ``ContigTree``. (Fixes: 10.gh\ :sub:`issue`)
-  Fixes mistake in the ``ContigTree.lineages`` function. (Fixes:
   10.gh\ :sub:`issue`)
-  Adds an option to account for discontinuities in
   ``ContigTree.lineages``.
-  Fixes the ``WepyHDF5.observable_field_names`` function.
-  Fixes the ContigTreeProfiler functions for FE profiles

.. _section-1:

1.0.7 - 2020-11-12
------------------

-  Adds a check to make sure the ``platform`` for the
   ``runners.openmm.OpenMMRunner`` is a string and not an actual
   ``Platform`` object.
-  Fixes the :sub:`tranchecumulativepartition` function in the
   ``analysis.profiles`` module.
-  Pins version of ``h5py`` to less than version 3, which introduced
   breaking API changes.

.. _section-2:

1.0.6 - 2020-09-28
------------------

-  Fixes the ``WepyHDF5.get_trace_field`` function.

   Previously I had implemented a chunking strategy to improve
   performance for situations with very long traces. This has a bug
   somewhere in it. For the time being we have just reverted this
   optimization to the naive (but correct) approach. If an optimized
   version is introduced it will be made explicit (either in the
   ``get_trace_field`` call, or as a wrapper or separate method).

.. _section-3:

1.0.5 - 2020-09-14
------------------

-  Work around fix for final snapshot in orchestrator being deleted if
   it is the same hash as the last checkpoint snapshot.

.. _section-4:

1.0.4 - 2020-08-27
------------------

-  Fixes the broken CLI interface. Moves it into the standard
   ``__main__.py`` module.

.. _section-5:

1.0.3 - 2020-08-19
------------------

-  This fixes an issue with the MacroStateNetwork that allows for

different shapes of state assignment arrays. This was previously an
issue but did not completely solve the issue.

.. _section-6:

1.0.2 - 2020-08-13
------------------

-  Fixes too-large chunk size when copying observable run data to other
   files in ``WepyHDF5.copy_run_slice``
-  Improves docstrings for the MacroStateNetwork methods

.. _section-7:

1.0.1 - 2020-08-07
------------------

This fixes an issue with the MacroStateNetwork that allows for different
shapes of state assignment arrays.

.. _section-8:

1.0.0 - 2020-08-04
------------------

Changes in rc6:

-  adds feature to make weighted transition counts from simulation data.
   This was also made the way that the MacroStateNetwork calculates the
   counts and transition probabilities matrices.
-  Fixed initialization errors in the TaskMapper which would cause a
   zombie job.
-  Fixed implementation of the CPU Task process for OpenMM.
-  Fixed sim maker details in wepy\ :sub:`tools`

Changes in rc5:

-  adds simulation monitoring via prometheus (or whatever) as a feature

Changes in rc4:

-  fixes bugs introduced to work mappers from rc2

Changes in rc3:

-  removed integration with ``openmmtools.testsystems`` in favor of
   ``openmm_systems`` fork

Changes in rc2:

-  adds support for setting the OpenMM Platform at ``run_segment`` or in
   ``pre_cycle``
-  add support for parametrizing apparatus components (runner,
   resampler, or BC) in the orchestration ``Configuration`` object.
-  Fixes ``wepy_tools.sim_makers`` for no longer default arguments for
   resamplers.
-  minor bugfixes found during testing.

Changes in rc1:

-  fixes bug in WorkerMapper

1.0.0rc1 - 2020-04-09
