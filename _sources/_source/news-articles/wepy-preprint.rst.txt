A preprint for the academic paper describing ``wepy`` has been published
on `ChemRxiv <https://chemrxiv.org/s/369c2530c150add1450b>`__.

This paper goes into more detail regarding some of the relationships of
the ``wepy`` architecture to the mathematical descriptions of Weighted
Ensemble (WE) in general.

It also describes some of the challenges and solutions that ``wepy``
solves with regards to the complexity of WE trajectory data that is
different from normal linear trajectories.

In these respects it is a great supplementary resource for understanding
some of the higher-level issues ``wepy`` solves.

Enjoy,
