Installation
============

To install from pip:

.. code:: bash

   pip install wepy

To install the optional, but likely desired feature, OpenMM you should
probably just use the omnia channel on conda, otherwise you will need to
compile it yourself.

.. code:: bash

   conda install -c omnia openmm

A helpful tip is to use the channel to specify which version of CUDA you
want OpenMM compiled with. For example if you want OpenMM compiled on
CUDA 10.0 you can use the channel 'omnia/label/cuda100', e.g.:

::

   conda install -c omnia/label/cuda100 openmm

There are some optional features you can install as well using the
"extras" spec in pip. The base package aims to be very easy to install
but lacks a lot of functionality that makes ``wepy`` useful for
molecular dynamics. Currently, these are:

md
   extra packages for molecular dynamics
distributed
   extra packages to allow for distributed analysis
prometheus
   for monitoring simulations via `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io>`__
all
   installs all extras

Check the setup.py file under ``extras_requirements`` for the full
listing.

.. code:: bash

   pip install wepy[md]

You can always install from git as well for the latest:

.. code:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/ADicksonLab/wepy.git

If installation went alright you should have this command line interface
for working with orchestration available:

.. code:: bash

   wepy --help
