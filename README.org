** Goals

** Rationale

** Broad Requirements
1. scalable number of workers across heterogeneous hardware
2. use of a proper message passing interface for communication (i.e. not the filesystem)
3. modular, but cohesive, with respect to binning (recursive etc.),
   order parameter calculation, and MD engine
4. rich non-platform specific (hdf5) trajectory datasets with API

** Specific Requirements
