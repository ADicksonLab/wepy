* Working on New Work Mapper with Trio

Set up testing environment in an LXD container since we are working
with threads and things locally.

** Make execution env

Make env:

#+begin_src bash
pyenv shell miniconda3-latest
inv env
#+end_src


** TODO Prometheus Cluster

# TODO:

Use the prometheus cluster definition jig:

Start the cluster:

#+begin_src bash
docker-compose -f input/compose/compose.yaml up
#+end_src
