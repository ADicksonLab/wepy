** Piping around

#+begin_src bash
python source/stdout_log.py | tee _output/log.eliot.json | eliot-tree
#+end_src

** File based

Run a script and then you can read the log from the output:

* Prometheus

Download and install prometheus and grafana:

#+begin_src bash
inv prometheus-install
inv grafana-install
#+end_src

You can configure for which jobs you want prometheus to scrape from in
the ~input/prometheus.yaml~ file.

Then start the server with:

#+begin_src bash
inv prometheus-start
#+end_src

The URL and port will be printed.

Then you can connect a grafana server to it after you start the
grafana server:

#+begin_src bash
inv grafana-start
#+end_src

The port and URL will be printed.
