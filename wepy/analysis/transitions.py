"""Collection of routines for counting transitions and calculating
transition probability matrices.

There are two basic data structures used in this module for edge
transitions: dictionary based and matrix based.

The dictionary based approach is used to interface with graph
representations, like in the
~wepy.analysis.network.MacroStateNetwork~.

Arrays are used as an interface to numerical libraries which use this
to calculate other properties such as steady-state probabilities.

Wepy is primarily meant to support expedient data structuring and will
not support the latter numerical calculations and is left up to
external libraries and domain specific code.

Routines
--------

transition_counts : Given a structured array of assignments of
    microstate to macrostate labels and a listing of all kinetic
    transitions over the microstates returns the counts of transitions
    between each macrostate as a dictionary mapping macrostate
    transition edges to the total counts each microstate transition.

counts_d_to_matrix : Converts a dictionary mapping macrostate
    transition edges to a asymmetric transition matrix.

normalize_counts : Normalizes outgoing transition counts from each
    macrostate to 1 for a transition counts matrix.

transition_counts_matrix : Given a structured array of assignments of
    microstate to macrostate labels and a listing of all kinetic
    transitions over the microstates returns the counts of transitions
    between each macrostate as an assymetric transition counts matrix.

transition_probability_matrix : Given a structured array of assignments of
    microstate to macrostate labels and a listing of all kinetic
    transitions over the microstates returns the probability of transitions
    between each macrostate as an assymetric transition probability matrix.

run_transition_counts_matrix : Generates an asymmetric transition
    counts matrix directly from a single WepyHDF5 run.

run_transition_probability_matrix : Generates an asymmetric transition
    probability matrix directly from a single WepyHDF5 run.
