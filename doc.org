** Resampling data format

Walker resampling is to be recorded as a list of the action taken and
the associated data. For cloning and merging there is 4 enumerated
actions with the data associated:
- NOTHING, walker_slot_idx :: the walker is not to be cloned or merged
     the index is the slot it will occupy in the next step which must be open
- CLONED, walker_slot_idxs[n_clones] :: the walker is to be cloned to
     the given walker slots, these slots must be available
- SQUASHED, keep_merge_walker_slot_idx :: this walker will donate it's
     probability to another walker and "merged" but its state will be
     lost, the index is the walker_slot_idx of the KEEP_MERGE walker
     before resampling
- KEEP_MERGE, walker_slot_idx :: this walker will have at least one
     squashed walker donate its probability and be merged, the index
     is the walker slot index it will occupy in the next cycle.
